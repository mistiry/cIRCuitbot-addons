# gitGud

This module is a silly little, slighly troll-ish, way that users can tell others users (by giving the other user's name as the argument to `command`) to GIT GUD.

## Installation

Copy the root `gitGud` folder into the `modules` directory where you installed the main bot. Add `gitGud` to the modules section of the bot config file.
